To run the attestable launcher.py, place in the current
directory the "bobServer.key.pem", that is a file with
bobServer's private key in PEM format.

The key should correspond to the public key included
in bobServer's certificate: bobServer.cert.pem

Both bobServer.key.pem and bobServer.cert.pem can be
generated by python or openssl. I used the latter.
