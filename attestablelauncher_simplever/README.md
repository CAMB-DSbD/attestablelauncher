# Simple version of th attestable launcher
__attestablelauncher_simple.py__ is an inmature version of
the attestable launcher.
More refined versions of the attestable launcher are
1. attestablelauncher.py located in the main subdirectory.
1. attestablelauncher_nointeractive.py (located in the attestablelauncger_nointeractive
   subdirectory) is also more mature than this version.

I'm keeping this attestablelauncher_simple.py only
for me, namely, for conducting some testing. Thus, I am not 
developing it further.

To run the attestablelauncher_simple.py follow the steps described
for the attestable_launcher.py in its README.md file.
