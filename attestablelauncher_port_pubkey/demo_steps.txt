bash-3.2$ pwd

bash-3.2$ 



1) Compile the server (ser) to be launched within the
   attestable

bash-3.2$ cc -o ser sersndrcv_host_pid_port_pubkey.c



2) Compile the client that I use to interact remotely
   with ser through a port number and possibly using
   the ser's public key.
   In this run, cli does not use ser's public key. It
   contracts ser directly.
bash-3.2$ cc -o cli clisndrcv_host_pid_port_pubkey.c



3) Start the attestablelauncher
bash-3.2$ python3 attestablelauncher.py
An instance of Signmessage has been created


Bob's server running... Its PEM pass phrase is: camb

Enter PEM pass phrase:

4) Start the client that contacts the attestablelauncher 
   and request to launch the execution of a program (ser
   in this example) within the attestable.

bash-3.2$ python3 cliRqExecProgInAttestable.py

 Alice's client running. My PEM pass phrase is camb 

Enter PEM pass phrase:
I'm ('127.0.0.1', 60766)

5)  The server is still running within the attestable
    and listening at port number 60768
bash-3.2$ ps
  PID TTY           TIME CMD
53088 ttys000    0:00.04 -bash

bash-3.2$ 



6) Ser can be contacted only through the correct
   port number notifies to the attestable launcher
   who notifies it to the client that requested the
   execution of ser.


6.1 Attempt to interact with ser through an incorrect 
    port number.
bash-3.2$ cli 127.0.0.1 6076
The serverhostname is : 127.0.0.1
connect error




6.2 Attempt to interact with ser through the correct 
    port number.
bash-3.2$ cli 127.0.0.1 60768
The serverhostname is : 127.0.0.1
Connected

Reply received from server: 
Hello Client , Ive received your connection. But I have to go now, bye




7) Stop the attestablelauncher by Crtl^C

9) Attempts to connect to ser through the correct 
fail
